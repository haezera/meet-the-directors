What up future media directors. Hope it's all going well. I hope this is atleast used for one more year LOL.

_Instructions_:
- Add a file called `maps.py` with the mappings, as shown on the confluence page (https://csesoc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPB/pages/2984804369/Automating+the+Meet+the+Directors+planning+experience)
  - Put this file in the base folder of the project
- Create a folder called data in the base folder of the project
- Run the script once you have python3 and the required packages installed

This isn't a guaranteed to work thing and I'm sure there will be bugs. If you have my contact feel free to reach out to me somehow.
